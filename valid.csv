671,2140,why is there no raii in net being primarily a c developer the absence of raii resource acquisition is initialization in java and net has always bothered me the fact that the onus of cleaning up is moved from the class writer to its consumer by means of try finally or nets using construct seems to be markedly inferiori see why in java there is no support for raii since all objects are located on the heap and the garbage collector inherently does not support deterministic destruction but in net with the introduction of valuetypes struct we have the seemingly perfect candidate for raii a value type that is created on the stack has a well defined scope and c destructor semantics can be used however the clr does not permit a valuetype to have a destructormy random searches found one argument that if a valuetype is boxed it falls under the jurisdiction of the garbage collector and therefore its destruction becomes nondeterministic i feel that this argument is not strong enough the benefits of raii are big enough to say that a valuetype with a destructor cannot be boxed or used as a class memberto cut a long story short my question is are there any other reasons value types can not be used in order to introduce raii to net or do you think my argument about raiis obvious advantages are flawededit i must have not phrased the question clearly since the first four answers have missed the point i know about finalize and its nondeterministic characteristics i know about the using construct and i feel these two options are inferior to raii using is one more thing the consumer of a class must remember how many people forgot to put a streamreader in a using block my question is a philosophical one about the language design why is it the way it is and can it be improvedfor instance with a generic deterministically destructible valuetype i can make the using and lock keywords redundant achievable by library classes public struct thisposert where t ithisposable t val public thisposert t val t public t value get return val thisposer currently illegal if val defaultt valthispose i cannot help but end with a apropos quotation which i once saw but cannot currently find its originyou can take my deterministic destruction when my cold dead hand goes out of scope anon,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1531,5885,how best to use xpath with very large xml files in net i need to do some processing on fairly large xml files large here being potentially upwards of a gigabyte in c including performing some complex xpath queries the problem i have is that the standard way i would normally do this through the systemxml libraries likes to load the whole file into memory before it does anything with it which can cause memory problems with files of this sizei do not need to be updating the files at all just reading them and querying the data contained in them some of the xpath queries are quite involved and go across several levels of parentchild type relationship i am not sure whether this will affect the ability to use a stream reader rather than loading the data into memory as a blockone way i can see of making it work is to perform the simple analysis using a streambased approach and perhaps wrapping the xpath statements into xslt transformations that i could run across the files afterward although it seems a little convolutedalternately i know that there are some elements that the xpath queries will not run across so i guess i could break the document up into a series of smaller fragments based on it is original tree structure which could perhaps be small enough to process in memory without causing too much havoci have tried to explain my objective here so if i am barking up totally the wrong tree in terms of general approach i am sure you folks can set me right,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1608,6204,using powermock or how much do you let your tests affect your design i have been a fan of easymock for many years now and thanks to so i came across references to powermock and it is ability to mock constructors and static methods both of which cause problems when retrofitting tests to a legacy codebase obviously one of the huge benefits of unit testing and tdd is the way it leads to forces a much cleaner design and it seems to me that the introduction of powermock may detract from that i would see this mostly manifesting itself asgoing back to initialising collaborators rather than injecting themusing statics rather than making the method be owned by a collaboratorin addition to this something does not quite sit right with me about my code being bytecode manipulated for the test i cannot really give a concrete reason for this just that it makes me feel a little uneasy as it is just for the test and not for productionat my current gig were really pushing for the unit tests as a way for people to improve their coding practices and it feels like introducing powermock into the equation may let people skip that step somewhat and so i am loathe to start using it having said that i can really see where making use of it can cut down on the amount of refactoring that needs to be done to start testing a classi guess my question is what are peoples experiences of using powermock or any other similar library for these features would you make use of them and how much overall do you want your tests influencing your design,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

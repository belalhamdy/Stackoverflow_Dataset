262,729,what is wrong with using inline functions while it would be very convenient to use inline functions at some situationsare there any drawbacks with inline functionsconclusionapparently there is nothing wrong with using inline functionsbut it is worth noting the following pointsoveruse of inlining can actually make programs slower depending on a functions size inlining it can cause the code size to increase or decrease inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease code size while inlining a very large function can dramatically increase code size on modern processors smaller code usually runs faster due to better use of the instruction cache google guidelinesthe speed benefits of inline functions tend to diminish as the function grows in size at some point the overhead of the function call becomes small compared to the execution of the function body and the benefit is lost sourcethere are few situations where an inline function may not workfor a function returning values if a return statement existsfor a function not returning any values if a loop switch or goto statement exists if a function is recursive sourcethe inline keyword causes a function to be inlined only if you specify the optimize option if optimize is specified whether or not inline is honored depends on the setting of the inline optimizer option by default the inline option is in effect whenever the optimizer is run if you specify optimize you must also specify the noinline option if you want the inline keyword to be ignored source,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

571,1819,dynamic sorting within sql stored procedures this is an issue that i have spent hours researching in the past it seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern rdbms solutions but as yet i have not found anything that really addresses what i see to be an incredibly common need in any web or windows application with a database backendi speak of dynamic sorting in my fantasy world it should be as simple as something likeorder by sortcol1 sortcol2this is the canonical example given by newbie sql and stored procedure developers all over forums across the internet why is not this possible they ask invariably somebody eventually comes along to lecture them about the compiled nature of stored procedures of execution plans in general and all sorts of other reasons why it is not possible to put a parameter directly into an order by clausei know what some of you are already thinking let the client do the sorting then naturally this offloads the work from your database in our case though our database servers are not even breaking a sweat 99 of the time and they are not even multicore yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months for this reason alone having our databases handle sorting wouldnt be a problem additionally databases are very good at sorting they are optimized for it and have had years to get it right the language for doing it is incredibly flexible intuitive and simple and above all any beginner sql writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it make changes do maintenance etc when your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify and shorten development time this seems like an obvious choicethen there is the web issue i have played around with javascript that will do clientside sorting of html tables but they inevitably are not flexible enough for my needs and again since my databases are not overly taxed and can do sorting really really easily i have a hard time justifying the time it would take to rewrite or rollmyown javascript sorter the same generally goes for serverside sorting though it is already probably much preferred over javascript i am not one that particularly likes the overhead of datasets so sue mebut this brings back the point that it is not possible or rather not easily i have done with prior systems an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting it was not pretty nor intuitive simple or flexible and a beginner sql writer would be lost within seconds already this is looking to be not so much a solution but a complicationthe following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything nor are they indicative of my abilities as a tsql programmer they are what they are and i fully admit they are confusing bad form and just plain hackwe pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure let us call the parameter just sort and from that we determine a bunch of other variables for example let us say sort is 1 or the defaultdeclare sortcol1 as varchar20declare sortcol2 as varchar20declare dir1 as varchar20declare dir2 as varchar20declare col1 as varchar20declare col2 as varchar20set col1 storagedatetimeset col2 vehicleidif sort 1 default sortbegin set sortcol1 col1 set dir1 asc set sortcol2 col2 set dir2 ascendelse if sort 2 reversed order default sortbegin set sortcol1 col1 set dir1 desc set sortcol2 col2 set dir2 descendyou can already see how if i declared more colx variables to define other columns i could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of sort to use it it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clauseorder by case dir1 when desc then case sortcol1 when col1 then storagedatetime when col2 then vehicleid end end desc case dir1 when asc then case sortcol1 when col1 then storagedatetime when col2 then vehicleid end end case dir2 when desc then case sortcol2 when col1 then storagedatetime when col2 then vehicleid end end desc case dir2 when asc then case sortcol2 when col1 then storagedatetime when col2 then vehicleid end endobviously this is a very stripped down example the real stuff since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending and each supporting bidirectional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases yeah it gets hairy really quickthe idea is that one could easily change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime but the pseudoflexibility at least in this simple example really ends there essentially each case that fails a test because our sort method does not apply to it this time around renders a null value and thus you end up with a clause that functions like the followingorder by null desc null storagedatetime desc blah blahyou get the idea it works because sql server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses this is incredibly hard to maintain as anyone with any basic working knowledge of sql can probably see if i have lost any of you do not feel bad it took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it thankfully it does not need changing often otherwise it would quickly become not worth the troubleyet it did workmy question is then is there a better wayi am okay with solutions other than stored procedure ones as i realize it may just not be the way to go preferably i would like to know if anyone can do it better within the stored procedure but if not how do you all handle letting the user dynamically sort tables of data bidirectionally too with aspnetand thank you for reading or at least skimming such a long questionps be glad i did not show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting dynamic filteringtextsearching of columns pagination via rownumber over and trycatch with transaction rollbacking on errors behemothsized does not even begin to describe themupdatei would like to avoid dynamic sql parsing a string together and running an exec on it defeats a lot of the purpose of having a stored procedure in the first place sometimes i wonder though if the cons of doing such a thing wouldnt be worth it at least in these special dynamic sorting cases still i always feel dirty whenever i do dynamic sql strings like that like i am still living in the classic asp worlda lot of the reason we want stored procedures in the first place is for security i do not get to make the call on security concerns only suggest solutions with sql server 2005 we can set permissions on a peruser basis if need be at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly critiquing the pros and cons of this approach is perhaps for

1078,3764,script minification and continuous integration with msbuild on a recent project i have been working on in caspnet i have some fairly complicated javascript files and some nifty style sheets as these script resources grow in size it is advisable to minify the resources and keep your web pages as light as possible of course i know many developers who handfeed their javascript resources into compressors after debugging and then deploy their applicationswhen it comes to source control and automated builds in the satisfying world of continuous integration thank you cruisecontrolnet hand compression will simply not do the only way to maintain source control and offer compressed resources is to keep jscss source their minified brethren in a separate directory structure then register only one set of resources or the other in codebehind however if a developer makes a change to jscss source and then fails to recompact it and check in both versions then youare codeline is now out of sync not to mention ineleganti am thinking that it would be nice to write a custom executable if one does not exist yet for the ccnet task block which would find and compress all javascript and css resources in the target directory after the build action but before the aspnet publish to target this way developers would only work on js and css source and users would only get the minified resourcesis there an application that already performs this task and if not what kind of resources should i look to install on the build server to have ccnet executethe closest question i could find here to this one required nant which is not an option in my caseeditdave ward now has a great article on how to automatically minify in visual studio at his site,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

an exe that depends on prj2prj2 is a dll that exports some functionsthe problem i am running into is that the library builds its obj pdb lib dll etc files in the same directory as it is sconscript file while the exe builds its files in the same directory as its sconscript the application successfully builds both the prj2 dependency and itself however you cannot run the resulting exe because it cannot find the library it needs because it is in the other directoryquestionhow can i get multiple projects that have dependences to output their binaries and debug information into a common directory so that they can be executed and debuggedpotential solutionsthis is what i have thought of so fari tried using variantdir previously called builddir however this does not seem to work perhaps i am messing something up herei could potentially tell the compiler and the linker explicitly via fofd for example where to drop their files is this the best or only solutionexecute a copy command on the resulting binaries this seems like a hack and quite a pain to managemaintainupdatei updated the file structure and file contents below to reflect the working solution in it is entirety

1274,4677,parallelization what causes java threads to block other than synchronization io short version is in the titlelong versioni am working on a program for scientific optimization using java the workload of the program can be divided into parallel and serial phases parallel phases meaning that highly parallelizable work is being performed to speed up the program it runs for hoursdays i create a number of threads equal to the number of cpu cores on the machine i am using typically 4 or 8 and divide the work between them i then start these threads and join them before proceeding to a serial phaseso far so good whats bothering me is that the cpu utilization and speedup of the parallel phases is nowhere near the theoretical maximum eg if i have 4 cores i expect to see somewhere between 350400 utilization as reported by top but instead it bounces around between 180 and about 310 using only a single thread i get 100 cpu utilizationthe only reasons i know of for threads not to run at full speed are blocking due to io blocking due to synchronizationno io whatsoever is going on in my parallel threads nor any synchronization the only data structures shared by the threads are readonly and are either basic types or nonconcurrent collections so i am looking for other explanations one possibility would be that several threads are repeatedly blocking for garbage collection but that would only seem to make sense in a situation with memory pressure and i am allocating well above the required maximum heap space any suggestions would be appreciatedupdate just in case anyone is curious after some more investigation i tweaked the code for general performance and am seeing better utilization even though nothing i changed has to do with synchronization however some of the changes should have resulted in fewer new heap allocations in particular i got rid of some use of iterators and termporary boxed numbers the cern colt library for highperformance java computing was useful here it provides collections like intarraylist doublearraylist etc for basic types so i think garbage collection was probably the culprit,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1285,4713,using boostshared ptr in a librarys public interface we have a c library that we provide to several different clients recently we made the switch from using raw pointers in the public interface to using boostsharedptr instead this has provided an enormous benefit as you might guess in that now the clients no longer have to worry about who needs to delete what and when when we made the switch i believed it was the right thing to do but it bothered me that we had to include something from a thirdparty library in our public interface generally you avoid that kind of thing if you can i rationalized it that boost was practically part of the c language now and our use case requires that both the client code and the library hold pointers to the objects however recently one of our clients has asked us if we could switch to using a neutral smart pointer class in the interface because our library is essentially forcing them to a particular version of boost a point which i certainly understand and appreciate so now i am wondering what the best course of action might be i have thought about it a little bit and wondered about creating a simple smart pointer class that simply held a real boost smart pointer but then the clients would probably immediately stuff one of those into their flavor of boostsharedptr and then wed be three shared pointers deep which might be a problem or it might not anyway i would love to hear some opinions from the community about the best way to solve this problemedit i originally said transfer of ownership but i should have specified that code on both sides of the api boundary need to hold a pointer to the object,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1319,4888,dealing with timezones in php some issues with timezones in php have been in the back of my mind for a while now and i was wondering if there are better ways to handle it than what i am currently doingall of the issues revolve around reformating database stored dateswhen dealing with a site that has to support multiple timezones for users to normalize the timezone offest of stored timestamps i always store it with the server timezone using the current timestamp attribute or the now function this way i do not have to consider what timezone was set for php when the timestamp was entered since php time functions are timezone aware for each user according to his preference i set the timezone somewhere in my bootstrap file usingdate default timezone settimezonewhen i am looking to format dates with the php date function some form of conversion has to take place since mysql currently stores timestamp in the format ymd his with no regard to timezone you could simply rundate dateformatstrtotimedbtimestampthe problem with this is that date and strtotime are both timezone aware functions meaning that if the php timezone is set differently from the server timezone the timezone offset will apply twice instead of once as we would liketo deal with this i usually retrieve mysql timestamps using the unix timestamp function which is not timezone aware allowing my to apply date directly on it thereby applying the timezone offset only oncei do not really like this hack as i can no longer retrieve those columns as i normally would or use to fetch all columns sometimes it simplifies queries greatly also sometimes it is simply not an option to use unix timestamp especially when using with opensource packages without much abstraction for query compositionanother issue is when storing the timestamp when usage of current timestamp or now is not an option storing a php generated timestamp will store it with the timezone offset which i would like to avoidi am probably missing something really basic here but so far i have not been able to come up with a generic solution to handle those issues so i am forced to treat them casebycase your thoughts are very welcome,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

1537,5903,microsoft exception handling block is not it a perfect example for overengineering ever since microsoft has introduced the application blocks i have been bumping into people who use the exception handling application block i have recently had a closer look myself and would summarize the basic functionality as follows skip the following block if you already know what it doesthe exception handling application block aims to centralize and make fully configurable with config files the following key exception handling taskslogging an exceptionreplacing an exceptionwrapping an exceptionpropagating an exceptionetcthe library does that by having you modify your try catch blocks as followstry run codecatchdataaccessexception ex bool rethrow exceptionpolicyhandleexceptionex data access policy if rethrow throw based on what is specified in the appconfig for the policy name see here for docs handleexception will either throw a completely new exception replace the original exceptionwrap the original exception in a new one and throw thatswallow the exception ie do nothinghave you rethrow the original exceptionadditionally you can also configure it to do more stuff beforehand eg log the exceptionnow heres my problem i completely fail to see how it can be beneficial to make it configurable whether an exception is replaced wrapped swallowed or rethrown in my experience this decision must be made at the time you write the code because youll typically have to change the surrounding or calling code when you change the exception handling behaviorfor example your code will likely start to behave incorrectly when you reconfigure such that a particular exception thrown at a particular point is now swallowed instead of rethrown there might be code after the catch block that must not be executed when the exception occurs the same goes for all other possible changes in exception handling eg replace rethrow swallow wrapso to me the bottom line is that the exception handling block solves problems that really do not exist in practice the exception logging and notifying bit is fine but is not all the other stuff just a perfect example for overengineering,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1668,6430,about memory management in java and c well i have been given an assignment to basically figure out how memory allocation works for whatever language i will be using after some research i have some questions and doubts which i would like to get some insight in for examplei read here that java specifies exactly how the stack contents are organized looking at the jvm spec structure it basically says the stack contains frames and that the frames contain whatever is inside the class by properly allocating the variables and functions maybe i am missing something here but i do not understand how this is any different than what c does i ask because the first link says javas specification of stack contents avoid compiler incompatibilitiesalso i have yet to find how the memory segments are exactly organized on top of each other for example i know the memory is divided into global variables call stack heap and code for c yet i do not know if the heaps address is higher than the stacks or if that depends on the implementation i also wonder whether a java program has more than that and how it would be laid out as well i imagine there is a standard since the jvm has to know where it all is to use it though i suppose it could just have the pointers and leave the rest to the os i imagine too that there must be at least a de facto standardanother the thing i do not understand is the runtime constant pool it is supposed to be a perclass or perinterface runtime representation of the constant pool table in a class file but i do not think i understand what it does it seems to have a tag to indicate what type the structure in question is then the name of the structure given by the programmer or assigned by the underlying system then it seems the rest of it varies with whatever the tag describes a thread an array etcif my interpretation of the runtime constant pool is right then why are they necessary as well as stack frames is it because stack frames only take care of the stack segments and the runtime constant pool must also have pointers for the heap allocated memory,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1871,7349,c how to make a form remember its bounds and windowstate taking dual monitor setups into account i have made a class which a form can inherit from and it handles form location size and state and it works nicely except for one thing when you maximize the application on a different screen than your main one the location and size before you maximized gets stored correctly but when it is maximized according to its previous state it is maximized on my main monitor when i then restore it to normal state it goes to the other screen where it was before when i then maximize it again it of course maximized on the correct screenso my question is how can i make a form when it is maximized remember what screen it was maximized on and how do i restore that when the form opens againkind of complete solution to problemi accepted the answer which had a very good tip about how to if on screen but that was just part of my problem so here is my solutionon loadfirst get stored bounds and

1904,7492,developing a robocode type game with net for a school assignment i am currently in my final year at school studying for a higher national diploma in computer studies and basically in this final semester we need to develop a software project that basically incorporates a whole systemnow what i am thinking of doing is something along the lines of robocode but instead of java i will be doing this with the net frameworkwhat is robocode for those of you do not know what robocode is it is basically a sort of programming game in where people develop their own robots using methods from the class interfaces and downloadable classes that exist and then they fight each other in an autonomous battle in an arenalike such so basically as i said i want to recreate this sort of scenario using the net frameworkand i am posting this question here on stackoverflow in hope that more experienced developers will be able to guide me in the right direction for this projectwhat i have in mind up till now is basically to createan offline application that will serve as the battle arena and the userinterface to create new battles with existing robots and suchan online interface that players will able to use to register new robots view past tournament scores etcand obviously the class interfaces that players will need to use to create their robotsanimation and graphics for the actual battlesnow of course there will be some sort of animation and movement when the battle occurs and i have not decided what yet to use as a medium for thisthe options i currently have in mind aredeveloping as i said in the first above bullet points an offline application that will serve as a battle grounds and all animations will be done using mainly c codeor develop a silverlight application that will handle the animations thus changing the scenario from an offline applcation to now an online oneor maybe the least feasable of them create the battle animations using javascript with something like the canvaswhat do you think could be more suitable for this particular scenario developing classes and interfacesfor the players to develop the robots i will provide certain class interfaces that they will be able to use like in robocodeexamples of such events and methods may includepublic void run public void onscannedrobotscannedrobotevent e walk ammount in pixels or we to walk to turnright value in degrees for an angular turn etchere is a snippet from code in robocode java public class myfirstrobot extends robot public void run while true ahead100 turngunright360 back100 turngunright360 for then to actually make the battles happen i am thinking of using reflection to actually read what methods the user is actually making use of and implementing them to run and be invoked at particular moments of the battle and suchnow what i kindly and humbly ask of you experienced developers is to guide me a bit through this project of mine and advise me on what needs to be donefor starters is this project feasible at all and if it actually is from where do i need to actually start with my projectas regards technologies and software i intend to be using are net framework 35 with c 30linq language integrated querysql server 2008microsoft visual studio 2008jquery frameworkpossibly silverlighti thank you all even for managing to read up to this point in my question and i will need and appreciate greatly all the help i can get to finish this projectthank you for your time and effortbtw up till now apart from robocode i have found these games that are similar to what i am trying to createnrobotvirii thanks marc,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
